# 3D GRAPHICS ENGINE

3D graphic engine develop in Qt by ![Lucas Garcia](https://github.com/Skyway666) and ![Adri√† Ferrer](https://github.com/Adria-F)

## Techniques implemented

This engine uses deferred rendering as the main system. In order to implement it, we are using various textures for storing information. These will later be used in different render passes to calculate the required effects.

### Storing geometry information

The main textures used, will store geometry information: Position, Normals, Colors and Depth.

</p>

### Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion

A screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO) is calulated using normals and depth textures and then rendering itself into another texture.

This will be later used on the lighting pass as the ambient value.

</p>
Ambient Occlusion ON/OFF correspondingly (without any other ilumination).

### Local ilumination

We are using the phong shading techinque for local ilumination. In order to avoid unnecessary calculations, we will use spheres with custom radius to fit point lights, range of affect and screen-filling quads for directional lights. This way we only process the required fragments.

### Mouse picking with textured identifiers

The mouse picking system is implemented by assigning a unique identifier to each object and rendering it to a texture.

<p>

</p>

Then retrieve the apropriate pixel value according to the mouse position on click, convert it back to a identifier and select the corresponding object.

### Selected object outline

The selected object can be identified by an outline. This outline can be configured to change thickness and color.

</p>


### Background color and Infinite grid

The background color can be changed and will properly mix with the grid when active

</p>


### Depth of field

A depth of field technique is implemented that allows to change the depth focus and blur only certain elements.

</p>

### Configuring technique values

The values related with the previous effects, can be modified from the "Misc settings" tab.

<p>

</p>

Within the "Environment" box, we can change: background color, toggle the use of ambient occlusion and the value for ambient light.

In the "Editor visual hints" box, we can toggle the grid and the rendering of light sources as small spheres. As well as the thickness of the outline (1-5) and its color.

Finally, on the "Depth Of Field" box, we can customize the depth focus (the distance on which the camera will focus or the point with less blur) and the fallof start and end.
